# Tic Tac Toe Game
#### A simple, text-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java, designed for two human players. This project is an object-oriented approach to building a command-line game
### Features
2-player gameplay: Players alternate turns to place their markers (X and O) on the 3x3 grid.
Win detection: The game automatically detects when a player wins (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal alignment).
Draw detection: The game identifies when the board is full and declares a draw.
Restart functionality: After a win or draw, the game resets and asks for player names to start a new match.
Input validation: Ensures players cannot place markers in already occupied cells
